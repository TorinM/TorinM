I'm a full-stack engineer with a preference for backend and low-level systems. Building performant, domain driven computing platforms is what excites me the most and I am always looking for new opportunities! Interesting conversations about exciting technologies and programming languages are always fun, so reach out to me over LinkedIn! I self identify as a rustacean!

I also have in-depth knowledge of building a full AWS ecosytem to support multiple development environments. This also includes Infrastructure as Code with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and GitOps tooling for an active engineering team. I also have experience managing a team of engineers working on multiple projects. Feel free to reach out!
